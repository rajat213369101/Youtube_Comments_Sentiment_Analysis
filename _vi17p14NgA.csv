@dbsfan2009,My best card is pro unhinged karrion kross
@jeffreykosse2231,"I have an update

I used Unhinged rarity cards to finish Countdown run and this will be the case with Main Event as for that I may need Summer Slam 25. 

Also true for Challenger run which might take the last rarity of 2025."
@Zilla_333,So it's Not possible without paying for now :/ that sucks i want this Card so bad
@jeffreykosse2231,I got Adriana Rizzo Unhinged from the daily streak. Adriana is a Tough Alignment card.
@SBreezyReactions,2:32 Wrestlemania 41 Carlito is my highest. still only 3 days in
@jeffreykosse2231,"I was able to pick up Kronian Kross Unhinged thanks to the draft board rarity fill up which I missed due to maintenance that day. I have 3 Unhinged cards coming due to level up , daily streak and a rarity draft board pull."
@vill1520boys,I‚Äôm also struggling with arena 69 down charisma & speed
@vill1520boys,I can‚Äôt beat the female match that‚Äôs why I can win it I got ple Naomi & f1 bayley tag bayley charisma is too low
@hampertidegaming9285,My most powerful card is pro Tyrese Haliburton
@juliocesarcorreia7257,"My best cards is Kross haft heroic,Tyrese pro and Juggernaut F1"
@juliocesarcorreia7257,"I got Iyo before new tier and now it's happen again with Ultimate Warrior JB 
YEET JEY!"
@RuggedSource,"I know this game has been out since 2014 but I just started last week and there are SO many different events/matches/etc. it can be a bit confusing for a new player. Possible 'new player' guide for 2025, would be a great mini series."
@ThatYoungBoy99,I beat it late last night üòé. For the final match I used Unhinged Roman F1 with his special equipment tag with Vader with his special equipment . Second Match I used Tiffy with Dupri with both using WM shirt equipped then used 11K WWE universe then third match I used Kross and John cena main event card with supermove. Only dupri had momentum and I was using F3 maryse
@g.g.baxter4868,"Mine was Roman and Vader, ME Rhea and Lyra, Karrion and F3 normal Cena"
@g.g.baxter4868,Had two goals for campaign. Complete one before the guide came out. I did it. Get top 200. I was 273. But given how many people clearly didn't do it legit. Im taking that as a W too
@itstemplarstealth7219,Do all the cards have to be F3
@jeffreykosse2231,"I just started getting Unhinged rarity.I finished Countdown and I'm on Main Event to finish up. I have 15 Unhinged Cards. I did get Kronian Kross which I missed off Daily Streak Unhinged Week 1. I'm missing 6 base Wrestle Mainia XLI cards and I have 50. So now there's a good chance I could get the rest of those 6 before November which means in November everybody can pro up and I can pick up any Unhinged cards I missed.

I've taken Supercard as far as I cam."
@basSscur,no money = no LE Ultimate Warrior
@stephencordano487,My most powerful is a pro Unhinged Roman Reigns with the Ula Fala equipment
@tbuggie03,"I came back into playing the game with a fresh account and i've gotten lucky enough to get a f1 ethan page, but I'm keeping them low leveled because it fits better with my team."
@orlandomendez8202,Dude us normal players will always not be able to beat level 84 so stop!
@zacmendes359,"I was able to figure out how to win earlier today. My first time before the guide lol

My deck for Arena 84:

Match 1 - Unhinged F1 Mark Henry with Steph Vaquer horns maxed power WM41 elbow pads maxed in power & BP Roman F1 with His equipment maxed in power
Match 2 - Unhinged F2 Tiffany Stratton with wm41 tshirt maxed charisma & F2 Jordynne Grace SE with wm41normal tshirt maxed charisma
Match 3 - Half heroic Karrion Kross wit Sheamus Coat maxed power & Boom Bron Breakker with WM41 elbow pads maxed in power

Also had 5 momentum slots for Roman, Henry, Tiffy, Grace and Kross"
@LowBudgetKiwi,So basically without all the special cards and special equipment we can't do it
@Chungus-r3l,I'm glad you mentioned how good the summer legacy cards with the rollercoaster are. I wish they put those in the summer legacy fusion for the event.
@sexybeast6862,Thoughts on the new MITB cards? Could they be helpful?
@Drayden42,"I'm really kicking myself for getting back into supercard when I did.  I was only able to get the free WM41 shirt at the very end of the tier they gave everyone and didnt get any Sheamus special cards.  Missed Iyo LE by 1 star.

I'm sure I'll be able to get Warrior before he's gone, but feel like I have to wait til the right equipment comes out."
@melonzies,"My best card if a F1 Tyrese Haliburton, insane luck when i got it"
@WesWells6,Campaign makes me lose my smile
@sononight8773,or u spend your entire family on this game or u cheat duplicating card and equipagment
@michaeldirekt,"Hi JB.


I hope this message will be noticed by you, because I have a question, that I hope you can help me with.

Since the reset, one of my BP Stephanie Vaquer cards is labeled as ""in the Performance Center"" (which she isn`t).
That means I can`t pro her, or put/change any equipment on her.

I allready contacted the support twice in-game, but never got any answer (despite the promise of a response within 24 hrs).
Do you know another way to get in contact with someone from CatDaddy?

Thanks in advance for a possible reply.

Greets
Michael"
@Cody-m3g7k,Was there a redeem code also my best card is a 239 Vader LE
@adamtedder7120,Hey another shout-out hell yea
@brendanquinn628,Me and my buddy were talking about the equipment and thought it would be better if they eliminated the stats that you already rerolled into so you cant just keep getting repeat rolls
